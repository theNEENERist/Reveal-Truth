			<p class="text">The mission of the Reveal Apologetics Conference is to encourage and prepare the average Christian to be able to provide evidence for the truth of Christianity.  God calls each and every Christian to share life and to share Christ with non-Christians.  In the course of doing so, each of us will meet questions about our faith as well as objections.  The goal of the Reveal Apologetics Conference is help Christians be able to answer these questions and provide good solid answers.</p>
			<p class="text">The Christian faith is not irrational, nor does it exist apart from evidence.  On the contrary, as Jesus said in John 10:37-38 (NIV), “<sup>37</sup> Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does. <sup>38</sup> But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."  The miracles of Christ served as evidence supporting Jesus claims about himself.  God did not call us to a blind faith but to one that is based in reality and is also supported by historical and scientific evidence as well.</p>
			<p class="text">The goal of the Reveal Apologetics Conference is to, each year, present two top notch, nationally known Christian Apologists in order to train the average Christian to “provide answers for reason for the hope that is within” (1 Peter 3:15).</p>
