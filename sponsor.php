			<!-- <p class="text">The mission of the Reveal Apologetics Conference is to encourage and prepare the average Christian to be able to provide evidence for the truth of Christianity.  God calls each and every Christian to share life and to share Christ with non-Christians.  In the course of doing so, each of us will meet questions about our faith as well as objections.  The goal of the Reveal Apologetics Conference is help Christians be able to answer these questions and provide good solid answers.</p> -->
